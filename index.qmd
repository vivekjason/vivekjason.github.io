<font size= "5"> **Hi, I am Vivek Jason Jayaraj** </font>

I am currently a gazetting Public Health Physician working at the National Institutes of Health Malaysia.

My fields of interest lie in the intersection between data analytics, epidemiology, infectious disease and health systems. My experiences include projects revolving around the epidemiology of COVID-19, the utility of non-pharmaceutical interventions and the comparative effectiveness of health systems on COVID-19 transmission. I have been involved in developing mathematical, time-series and machine-learning models and analytics in forecasting infectious diseases, particularly dengue, COVID-19 and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD).

I believe that it is within the synergism between data and compassion that we find a better future. As such I strive to decrease the latencies of data solutions within infectious disease and the health system.
